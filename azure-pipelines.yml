# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       imageName: "ubuntu-latest"
#     mac:
#       imageName: "macos-10.13"
#     windows:
#       imageName: "vs2017-win2016"
#   maxParallel: 3

# pool:
#   vmImage: $(imageName)

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

  steps:
# ...
# do this after other tasks such as building
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
